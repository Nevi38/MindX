    <p id="tit">It was Halloween 2012. My senior year of
        high school

        I went to a Catholic school so we always
        had the day off after Halloween because

        it was considered a church holy day
        so my friends were game to start our
        weekend early
        or nights where we didn't go to parties
        we usually do the same thing
        we sit on my front steps for a couple of
        hours and joke around
        then we'll walk the neighborhood and
        usually end up at this shitty pizza
        place across town because the prices
        were so cheap
        since a few of us had recently broken up
        with our girlfriends we weren't in much
        of a party mood so we did our usual
        it's around 10 10 30 at night and the
        pizza joint is close enough for tonight
        there were three of us me my friend Pat
        my friend Jack
        we finished our food we fill our drinks
        and head out
        take it back to my house we had to cross
        this large mall parking lot
        that's about a four football fields long
        and too wide
        I should mention at this point that we
        aren't dumb naive kids
        we all had grown up in the city and had
        our fair share of urban experiences
        all three of us were pretty StreetWise
        and we're competent on the street by
        ourselves
        but we experienced something this night
        that we were totally unprepared for
        so we're walking through this parking
        lot and it's absolutely desolate not a
        soul in sight
        suddenly we see a white Tradesman van
        creeping slowly behind us about a
        hundred yards back
        another old white van cliche but I swear
        it's a real story
        I pointed out to my friends and we pick
        up our pace
        we pop the collars on our jackets and we
        hunch our shoulders out to make us seem
        a lot bigger than what we were
        in an instant the van speeds up and cuts
        off our path
        everything in the van is pitch black so
        we can't see anyone in there
        that's when someone calls out in a
        non-threatening voice
        hey man
        happy Halloween
        you guys like Halloween
        despite the jovial manner in which this
        was said
        a van doesn't cut you off in the parking
        lot unless it had bad intentions
        we had nowhere to go
        we could run but they're in a van that
        would catch up easily and we'd have to
        turn our backs to them
        he says it again
        hey man
        you guys like Halloween
        I respond trying to sound tough
        yeah but it's over now all right so
        we're heading home and you're on our way
        nah dude it ain't over
        we still got tons of candy in here
        the tone suddenly shifted and still we
        can't see anyone in the van
        three of us puff our chest out get ready
        for a fight
        after a brief silence that felt like it
        dragged on for hours
        Jack cuts the tension by the sternly
        sand
        Hey listen up man I don't know what you
        think you're about to do but if you
        don't leave
        it's gonna be a problem
        once he said that the back door of the
        van swung open and two very tall men
        stepped out I had black suits on with
        black leather gloves and were well built
        and strong looking
        but the most menacing thing was that
        they were both wearing these cheap Mitt
        Romney masks
        that's when we realized this wasn't a
        Halloween prank at that moment all three
        of us went to take off but the van
        started driving circles around us
        we had no idea how we were going to get
        out of this situation
        I have no idea what these guys were
        planning to do with three 18 year old
        men but they seemed like they knew what
        they were doing
        and we were all getting ready for the
        fight of Our Lives
        the van stopped
        and it looked like they were about to
        make a move this was it
        I mentioned that there was three of us
        that night
        it was at this moment that our friend
        Pat the one who had stayed silent up to
        this point leaned into the both of us
        quietly said
        okay
        hey this is a Hail Mary but
        get ready to [ __ ] run when I say go
        all right
        he didn't pick up one of our sodas which
        was in a cup and threw it with all his
        might at the driver's side window
        the window was open and the cup
        miraculously connected with the driver's
        head
        patch screen running we took off across
        the parking lot
        the van swelled off in the other
        direction and we hurried our asses home
        Jack and I were both confused as to why
        a simple cup of soda got them to give up
        their plans
        then we found out what actually happened
        while we were panicking Pat kept us cool
        he nonchalantly dumped out the drink
        that was in his hand
        and slipped a big ass rock into the cup
        then he waited for the right moment
        the driver thinking that this kid just
        threw a drink at him wound up getting
        pegged in the head with a rock
        it probably knocked him out cold
        would at least brought us enough time to
        put some distance between us all that
        was left after that was pulling off a
        miracle and getting the rock to hit
        maybe a guardian angel or God himself
        took care of that
        I'm still amazed by it but more of the
        story kids don't panic when you're in a
        tight spot
        if you lose you're cool you lose your
        fight
        [Music]
        I'm a 32 year old female living in
        Colorado
        and Halloween is by far my favorite time
        of the year
        but when Halloween stands out in my mind
        that I'll never forget
        and it's not for the right reasons
        it was 2007 and I was about 17 years old
        once it got dark I met up with a few of
        my friends Brittany Rick Curtis and
        Micah
        we were walking around a trailer park
        smoking weed and taking shots and just
        having a good time
        it must have been walking for about 20
        minutes we came up on this group of guys
        that were smoking a meth pipe just out
        in the open
        we just walked straight past them when
        one of them yelled hey as loud as
        possible
        we all stopped and turned around and
        Curtis said yeah
        one of the guys asked in a demanding
        voice
        Wanna Give me a hit of what you got
        there
        Curtis held up the roach
        we just finished smoking and he said
        sorry man we just finished it off
        they didn't reply
        they just turned away from us
        certainly one of them turned around and
        asked for five dollars again Curtis
        responded sorry man I'm broke the guy
        gave a really weird smile bearing his
        crooked yellow teeth
        but his eyes were dead and cold
        it was very unsettling and clearly a
        forced smile he then said oh all right
        you guys have a good night
        return back and started walking away
        something was off about that group of
        people
        but then again they were on hard drugs
        walk for about a minute until I heard a
        bunch of people running up behind us it
        was Halloween at that time so there was
        a lot of people everywhere
        but it was that group of people again
        and they were coming up fast
        we both are down the road and everyone
        ran off in different directions
        I jumped a few fences and hid inside a
        random person's shed my heart was
        beating so hard I thought it was about
        to explode
        I waited about 20 minutes slowly opened
        the shed and peered out I didn't see
        anyone so I started to look for my
        friends
        found Brittany and Rick
        we looked around for Curtis and Micah
        Curtis phone was dead Michael wasn't
        answering
        we finally found Curtis one of those
        Cycles stabbed him in the leg and took
        his ballage and his jeans were soaked in
        blood we caught 9-1-1 right away then we
        found Micah laying on the sidewalk she
        could barely get up and she told us that
        two of the guys jumped her and beat her
        as well as stealing her money from her
        pocket for reference Micah is about 115
        pounds and five foot one
        it disgusts me to think that full-grown
        men were so high that they thought it
        was okay to beat up an innocent small
        girl like that it definitely ruined one
        of my favorite holidays and I still
        think about it these years later
        if a random group of people ever call
        out to you
        just keep walking
        always carry a taser pepper spray just
        any weapon
        you never know what kind of weirdos are
        lurking out there in the dark
        oh
        thank you
        I'm a girl and this happened when I was
        about nine years old
        at the time I love the trick-or-treating
        my neighborhood
        this was short-lived because by then my
        neighborhood wasn't exactly safe anymore
        that year which was 1992. I attended a
        church Halloween party
        there were many kids that I recognized
        from school and from nearby areas
        I dressed up in a little devil costume
        that year complete with paste on horns
        and you know the usual
        yeah a little bold for a church party
        but
        several other kids were dressed as
        Devils and I saw many girls dressed as
        witches
        the party host who I'll call Father
        Francis stood greeting everyone I
        remember he was dressed like a version
        of Captain Hook
        every kid attending got goodie bags at
        the door from father Francis
        for some reason every kid who is dressed
        up as a witch or a devil got a baggie of
        homemade cookies
        they look like sugar cookies with
        powdered sugar dusting the tops
        the party was great fun but I was eager
        to get home and try a cookie
        father Francis had told us not to eat
        the cookies there because he said it's
        our little secret
        I saw nothing Sinister at the time but
        looking back something seemed weird and
        wrong
        when I got home I decided to try one the
        next day
        I remember finally trying a cookie
        almost immediately sped it out in the
        garbage
        it tasted really bad and the powdered
        sugar was bitter tasting
        my mom noticed my reaction and asked to
        try one her reaction was identical to
        mine
        she demanded to know where I've gotten
        these from
        I told her father Francis had given me a
        bag of them
        grabbing the bag she inspected the
        cookies
        she smelled the bag making a suspicious
        face
        and then she tasted the powdered sugar
        her eyes widened and she practically
        hurled the bag of cookies into the trash
        don't eat those honey all right those
        are bad very bad cookies
        this was a Saturday
        we had no way of learning fellow
        classmates or friends
        Monday I learned the worst had happened
        16 children all who had been given a bag
        of cookies have been hospitalized for
        contamination
        we learned the powdered sugar was in
        fact ant chalk of the 16 children that
        got sick two died because they eating a
        whole bag of cookies
        thankfully I never got sick because I
        only bitten one but never swallowed it
        father Francis ended up going to prison
        for 20 years for his involvement he
        claimed that his defense he was doing
        God's work by ridding the world of evil
        he turned out to be an evil man who felt
        no pity for the children who got sick
        order two who had sadly died
        I heard as they hauled him off to prison
        he kept screaming I did God's work I'm a
        tool of God I did nothing wrong
        I did nothing wrong
        from then on I never attended another
        church party of any kind
        and my trust for those figures was
        pretty much destroyed
        I also have almost never accepted baked
        goods from others again
        I kept thinking but if I had been one of
        those who had eaten a full bag
        chances are I've been hospitalized too
        or much worse
        the more the story is
        careful of anything you accept from
        others even if they're a person of cloth
        foreign
