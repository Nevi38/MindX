                <p>&ensp;&ensp;Halloween's origins can be traced back to the ancient Celtic festival known as
                    Samhain, which
                    was held on
                    November 1 in contemporary calendars. It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead
                    returned
                    to their homes, so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits.</p>

                <p>&ensp;&ensp;In addition to causing trouble and damaging crops, Celts thought that the presence of
                    the
                    otherworldly spirits made it easier for the Druids, or Celtic priests, to make predictions about
                    the
                    future. For a people entirely dependent on the volatile natural world, these prophecies were an
                    important source of comfort during the long, dark winter.</p>

                <p>&ensp;&ensp;To commemorate the event, Druids built huge sacred bonfires, where the people
                    gathered to
                    burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celts
                    wore
                    costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each otherâ€™s
                    fortunes.
                </p>

                <p>&ensp;&ensp;When the celebration was over, they re-lit their hearth fires, which they had
                    extinguished
                    earlier that evening, from the sacred bonfire to help protect them during the coming winter.</p>

                <p>&ensp;&ensp;The first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans traditionally
                    commemorated the
                    passing of the dead. The second was a day to honor Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees.
                    The
                    symbol of Pomona is the apple, and the incorporation of this celebration into Samhain probably
                    explains
                    the tradition of bobbing for apples that is practiced today on Halloween.</p>
